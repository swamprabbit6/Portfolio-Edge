# Portfolio-Edge
<!-- This project demonstrates a mock up portfolio for Samuel Harper's work as a web developer. The mock up features 5 different faux applications with the first one being prominently displayed as the largest. At the top of the screen is a nav bar which, when interacted with, takes the user to either the About Me, Portfolio, or Contact section of the page. The page has been stylized with a CSS page to give it a centered look. -->
